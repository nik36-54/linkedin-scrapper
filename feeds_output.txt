Feed 3: Como siempre me parece muy inspirador el post de   Jorge Inda , por ello, más que dar un consejo acerca de lo que dice os apunto mi reflexión sobre lo que dice, aprender de la sabiduría de algunas personas me parece una muy buena forma de mejorar: A menudo, nos enfrentamos a desafíos y problemas que pueden parecer abrumadores. Sin embargo, la clave radica en nuestra actitud y en cómo respondemos a ellos. La vida no se trata de evitar las dificultades, sino de aprender a disfrutar el proceso de resolverlas. Cada día, nuestras decisiones y hábitos moldean nuestro futuro. Si esperamos mucho de nosotros mismos y mantenemos una mentalidad positiva, podemos transformar cualquier reto en una oportunidad de crecimiento.   **Moraleja:** La felicidad no se encuentra en la ausencia de problemas, sino en la forma en que elegimos enfrentarlos. Agradece cada día, pues incluso en lo cotidiano, hay belleza y lecciones que aprender.   hashtag # CrecimientoPersonal   hashtag # ActitudPositiva   hashtag # Oportunidades
Feed 4: CONSEJOS DE ORO PARA LA VIDA. Siempre tendrás problemas. Aprende a disfrutar de la vida mientras los resuelves. Las personas no deciden su futuro, deciden sus hábitos y sus hábitos deciden su futuro. En la vida solo puedes controlar dos cosas: tu esfuerzo y tu actitud. No preguntes como iniciar. Inicia y luego pregunta como mejorar. La felicidad tiene menos que ver con el placer y más con el propósito. La vida es más dura cuando esperas mucho del mundo y poco de ti mismo. La vida es más fácil cuando esperas mucho de ti mismo y poco del mundo. Altos estándares, bajas expectativas. La mitad de tus problemas son simplemente tu mente haciendo de cosas menores parecer cosas mayores. No busques secretos cuando lo que necesitas son repeticiones. No te dejes controlar por tres cosas: la gente, el dinero o las experiencias pasadas. En cada reto o incluso tragedia, hay una oportunidad. Y si te entrenas para buscar la oportunidad, podrás tomar el control de la situación e incluso convertirla en algo positivo o, si no se puede convertir en algo bueno, al menos algo bueno podría salir de ella. Da las gracias todos los días, porque aunque creas no tener motivos para agradecer, tu día “normal” es el sueño de alguien más. Autor: Desconocido   hashtag # serloquequierover   hashtag # recursivos

Feed 26: 365 days of   Uniquirk 🏹   —1 lesson that changed what Entrepreneurship meant for me. Most people think entrepreneurship = freedom. Be your own boss.   Do whatever you want.   And no one to answer to. Reality? The opposite. After two years as an entrepreneur and 365+ days running a registered company, here’s what I’ve learned— Entrepreneurship doesn’t make you less accountable.   It makes you more accountable. You’re answerable to: → Clients who trust you with their money → Team members who rely on your leadership → Investors and stakeholders betting on your vision → Families whose livelihoods depend on your business If things go wrong? You own up. Even if it’s not your fault, you own up. A product fails due to a mistake? Your responsibility. A team member quits, delaying a project? Your problem. A client leaves because of poor service? Your accountability. The bigger you play, the bigger the stakes. And the bigger the responsibility. Yes, entrepreneurship can give you freedom. But only if you first embrace the weight of ownership. … P.s. Would love to hear from fellow founders— What’s your biggest lesson from building a business?

Feed 39: ₹13.48 crore disappeared. Imagine someone promises: — 48% returns on gold — 96% on silver — 520% returns on moissanite stones   Sounds too good to be true, right?   But if something sounds too good to be true, it is probably not real. A jewellery business promised these returns and Most people could not ignore this deal. Lakhs of investors put their money in, but by December 2024, everything failed and around 1.25+ lakh people were cheated.   But how did they pull off this scam? -- Torres Jewellery launched investment schemes apart from their retail outlets, presenting themselves as a credible business. -- Early investors got regular returns as promised and that encouraged more investments. -- They raised payout rates during festive seasons, bringing even more investors. When the payments were stopped, over ₹13.48 crore had already been scammed and the masterminds had left the country. This perhaps reminded you of Laxmi's chit-fund from the movie Hera Pheri. This is why it is said that consistently high returns are a red flag. So never invest in something you don’t understand and verify if the schemes are registered with regulatory bodies. Easy money is tempting but if you don't check, scams will happen. Do you know of someone who fell trap into this scam? hashtag # scam   hashtag # investing
Feed 40: Harassment of   BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus   students by   Ola   drivers in Hyderabad. Please read this very carefully 🙏   Me and   Anish Ahuja   were travelling to pune today regarding a B-Plan competition and we were getting late to catch our bus. After getting rejected by multiple drivers, our friend   Sahil Goyal   helped us get into his cab. He was going to lakdikapul and our bus stop was also nearby. In a hurry, we got in the car just to know  that, our driver mohammad waseem, asked for rs1000 for a trip and that too in the midway. Reacting to this we rebelled, but to no use. We decide to get down at lakdikapul and pay him the same amount i.e. rs400 being considerate. But to our suprise when we tried to get out and talk to sahil, he snatched sahil's phone and tried to stop us from taking our luggage. When we tried to take out the luggage, he forcefully pushed our luggage to the backseat and tried to   leave.In   reaction to this, anish got into the car and took out the luggage. He took advantage of this and snatched anish's phone and would give it back only if we paid him rs1000. I tried to stop him from leaving with the phone, but he pushed me on the road. It became a nuisance for the passerby's and a small crowd gathered to de-escalate the situation. I hope you take strict action against such drivers   Bhavish Aggarwal   and we get the right compensation. Chandana Deepti IPS   Hyderabad City Security Council (HCSC)   please look into the matter. Incidents like these make us question the safety of students in our own cities. hashtag # JusticeForStudents   hashtag # StudentSafety   hashtag # AccountabilityMatters

Feed 52: I went from working with service-based to working with product-based, and from being a developer to a manager. Changing careers isn’t always easy.   It felt like a big change, but I did it by focusing on a few important things: Visibility, Networking, and Showing My Value. 1) Make Your Work Visible: I kept my LinkedIn updated with new projects and skills. Sharing what I was working on helped me stay on people’s radar. ✨ Tip: Post about your work or ideas to show you’re growing. 2) Talk About Results: Instead of just saying what I did, I focused on the impact I made. ✨ Example: "Helped reduce app load time by 40%, boosting user retention by 20%." 3) Network with Purpose: I made connections on LinkedIn and at events. Offering help before asking for it made me memorable. ✨ Tip: Introduce people who could work well together. 4) Follow Up: After interviews, I sent a thank-you message to stay fresh in the interviewer's mind. ✨ Tip: Mention something specific from the interview in your follow-up. 5) Show Leadership: I shared how I worked well with teams and helped solve problems, even if I wasn’t in charge. ✨ Tip: Show examples of teamwork or leadership. By focusing on these, I switched and landed my dream role. 🌟 LinkedIn   LinkedIn Guide to Creating   LinkedIn Guide to Networking hashtag # CareerGrowth   hashtag # JobSearch   hashtag # CareerChange   hashtag # Networking   hashtag # Leadership
